    <h1> A Complete Guide to CSS Concepts and Fundamentals </h1>

    <p> This guide covers all the fundamentals of CSS - from syntax, selectors, and specificity to layouts and
        responsive media queries. </p>

    <p> Speaking CSS is like speaking English, or any other spoken language - there are many words, but you only end up
        using a small subset of them on a daily basis. Just like reading a dictionary isn't an efficient way to learn a
        language, looking at a big list of properties isn't helpful to learn CSS.</p>

    <h3> CSS Concepts and Fundamentals </h3>

    <p>
        Some people think CSS is really hard and it's too much of a hassle to learn. Some people think that since it's
        not a programming language (or is it?), it's so easy that you don't even have to bother learning it. Ultimately,
        there's a lot to CSS, but it doesn't have to be overwhelming. If you learn a few key concepts, you should feel
        confident looking at or thinking of any design and turning it into reality.</p>

    </p> I'm going to go over some of the parts of CSS that are important on a daily basis, and give some of tips and
        tricks I've come to learn over the years. If you just want some hints on how to make your design look pretty or
        , check out Design for Developers. I also think Web Design in 4 Minutes by Jeremy Thomas has an excellent,
        interactive introduction to the concepts of web design.</p>
    
    <h3> WHO IS THIS ARTICLE FOR? </h3>    

    <p> If you're a seasoned front end developer who already knows everything about CSS, please close this tab
        immediately and run as fast as you can to the nearest exit. If you've never heard of or used CSS before and
        don't know how to load CSS into an HTML page, this resource is also not for you.</p>

    <p> This article is for the middleground of people who have had to touch CSS a few times here and there but
        ultimately don't feel like they know what they're doing, or struggle with making basic layouts.</p>

    HTML Fundamentals
    Just as a recap, we'll be talking about how CSS applies to HTML a lot, so make sure you're familiar with what
    everything is referring to in HTML.

    Tag - element name (example: a)
    Attribute - HTML modifiers (example: href)
    Value - value applied to an attribute (example: http://tania.dev)
    Element - everything within the HTML tag - attributes, values, and content.
